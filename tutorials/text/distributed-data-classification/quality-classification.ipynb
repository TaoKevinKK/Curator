The [quality classifier](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/quality-classifier-deberta) is used to classify text as high, medium, or low quality. This helps with data annotation, which is useful in data blending for foundation model training. Please refer to the NemoCurator Quality Classifier DeBERTa Hugging Face page for more information about the quality classifier, including its output labels, here: https://huggingface.co/nvidia/quality-classifier-deberta.\n",

    "Before running this notebook, please see this [Installation Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/curator/latest/admin/installation.html#admin-installation) page for instructions on how to install NeMo Curator. Be sure to use an installation method which includes GPU dependencies."
